<FONT SIZE=3>
<B>TO BELIEVE IN THE LIFE OF LOVE;</B> to win in the fresh morning of our
youth the loyal love of faithful friends, who will go with us unmmoved
into the darkening shadows of life's closing day; and so to seek and to
find, to have and to hold the friendships that will abide. To think of God
as the common father of all men, and all men as a common brotherhood, thus
recognizing the continuity of the Divine and the solidarity of the human
life. To build somewhere in the wide world the sheltering walls of a home,
however humble and obscure, where Love shall glorify the wife, Duty
enshrine the mother, and Affection ennoble the child. To keep green the
sainted memory of our loved and lost, their faults forgotten, their
virtues enshrined in our hearts forever. To try bravely to do unto our
fellow men as we should do unto us, reckoning not their lineage nor their
wealth, but esteeming their manhood above their badge of rank. To let our  
lives be led by the spirits of Gentleness, Justice, and Mercy. And so to
be true to the Knighthood of Love. 
<BR><BR>
<B>TO WALK IN THE WAY OF HONOR;</B> to exalt the fundamental virtues of
the race; and, prizing every noble impulse, to realize so deeply the
baseness of deceit, that no obligation will be more binding than our plighted 
word. To be steadfast in the performance of every trust, and, spurning the
gaudy gifts of greed and power, to be content to live by our knightly vow
that our honor is dearer to us than our lives; and so to esteem the man's
character first, his culture second, and his pedigree not at all, unless
he be worthy of it. Emulating the chivalrous deeds of courtesy, and sealing
not our hearts against the torch of tenderness, to win the love and care of
some incorruptible woman. And so to be loyal to the Knighthood of Honor. 
<BR><BR>
<B>TO SERVE IN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH;</B> to open wide, Life's windows to the
revelations of heaven and earth. Avoiding the Phariseeism that belittles
the soul and scorning the bigotry that blights the mind, to respect every
altar of faith built in God's name, by every sincere worshiper to whom, if
we cannot give our sympathy, we shall not deny the kindness of our manly
silence; and, whatever our creed, to reverence the Christ as the Divine
Compassion for struggling humanity -- a compassion that, giving the world
its gospel of human service, saves men to the end that they may serve
their fellow men. 
<BR><BR>
To seek in nature, the meaning of the Infinite Truth; to understand that
the laws of growth are the laws of God to believe that the melody of
birds, the laughter of children the unmeasured sacrifice of motherhood,
and the ceaseless yearning of all men for a wider outlook and a nobler
existence are prophetic of the perfect joy and love of another world and
so believing, to find rest, as in the shadow of a great rock, against all
the storms that beset us; catching from the silence of the startlit
nights, the peace of the autumn days, the solemnity of the boundless seas,
that spirit of Hope and Faith which soothes hurt of grief, heals the wound
of wrong, and calms the fever of doubt. 
<BR><BR>
To welcome the achievements of art and science, religion and learning, 
labor and law, under whose radiant banners battle the hosts of progress;
honoring every honest student as the benefactor of his race, and every
consecrated school as a bulwark of the Republic; and so to be loyal to the
American university, as the home of American liberty, democracy, religion,
and culture. 
<BR><BR>
To guard with jealous care not only ancient rights of human freedom, in
whose name we shall destroy all wrong and oppression, but also the newer
rights of social service, the ultimate purpose of whose ministrations
shall be to give to every life, the opportunity to enjoy the earth in the
fullness of its beauty and grace, its comfort and good cheer; holding fast
to the conviction that whatever sweetens our natures, uplifts our ideals,
strengthens our character and disenthralls our spirits will us in the end
into the full stature of a noble manhood; and, so inspires, to cling to
the visions of our youth, and, despite the sordid struggles of the selfish
world, to practice every day, as lads in college, and men in the world,
the Faith of our Fraternity, thinking of it not only as the inspiring
Ideal of a militant Brotherhood, but also as as creative force for the
spiritual development of men, whose lives it shall dedicate to Love,
glorify with Honor, and conquer for Truth. And so to be faithful to the
Knighthood of Truth. 
<BR><BR>
<B>TO BELIEVE IN THE LIFE OF LOVE, TO WALK IN THE WAY OF HONOR,
TO SERVE IN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH -- this is the Life, the Way, and the Light
of Sigma Nu -- this is the Creed of our Fraternity.</B>
